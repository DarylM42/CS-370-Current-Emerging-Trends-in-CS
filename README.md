# Pirate Intelligent Agent – Portfolio Reflection

## Project Summary

This project focused on building a reinforcement learning agent capable of navigating a grid‑based pirate treasure environment. The starter materials included the game world, the environment rules, and the overall notebook structure. My contribution was the full implementation of the deep Q‑learning system. I created the neural network model, the replay memory, the epsilon‑greedy exploration strategy, and the training loop that updates the agent’s Q‑values based on its experiences. I also added the logic that allows the agent to learn from past actions and gradually improve its ability to reach the treasure.

How This Work Connects to Computer Science
Computer scientists design systems that solve problems in reliable and scalable ways. This matters because nearly every modern technology depends on someone who can break down a problem, model it clearly, and build a solution that behaves predictably under real‑world constraints. Reinforcement learning fits directly into that mindset. Instead of hard‑coding behavior, we create an agent that learns from experience and adapts to its environment.

When I approach a problem as a computer scientist, I start by understanding the rules of the system, identifying what information is available, and defining what success looks like. From there, I break the problem into smaller steps, test each part, and refine the solution until the behavior matches the goal. This project followed that pattern: understanding the environment, designing the learning algorithm, training the model, and evaluating how well the agent performed.

I also have ethical responsibilities to both the end user and the organization. My work should be transparent, safe, and aligned with the intended purpose of the system. Reinforcement learning can influence real decisions, so it is important to avoid unintended behavior, respect user expectations, and ensure that the system does not cause harm. Even though this project takes place in a simple game world, the same mindset applies to larger, real‑world applications.
